## About

Friends adds the ability to follow and connect with other users on WordPress Multisite.

It's a really powerful, straightforward friends system that doesn't require BuddyPress.

### A better network

One-click activation adds a 'Friends' menu to the WordPress dashboard that lets users easily search and add friends.

 Search by display name, username and email address

Users receive an email notification when they get a friend request and can choose to approve or reject that request.

 Easily manage friend requests with quick Approve and Reject

 Let users show their popularity by displaying a friends list in the sidebar using the bundled friends widget. Quickly visit your friends sites by clicking the linked avatars.

### Massively extensible

Best of all, Friends is built to integrate seamlessly with our other social plugins.

*   [Avatars plugin](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/avatars) - For Friends' avatars
*   [Community plugin](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/communities/) - Create communities with their own discussion boards, wikis, news dashboards, user lists and messaging facilities within their WP admin area.

All the best of social networking brought to your WordPress Multisite.
